"In this game, you will step into the mind of a man filled with regret because of the tragic loss of his family in a car accident. Haunted by guilt and constantly haunted by the belief that he killed his entire family, he falls into an inescapable cycle of pain and emptiness. Don't hesitate to fight through this nightmare world whereâ€Ž truth and illusion intersect, to experience what it's like to be trapped in an endless loop of regret and destruction."
